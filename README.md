# C-programs
Just a repo for maintaining and learning C. I have been repeating C by implementing different search algorithms and datastructures here. Specifically I have been using pointers and arrays quite a lot to that end. Unlike Python C is a programming language that allows the programmer to have more direct control, one has to allocate memory manually and one can make use of pointers and memory addresses. When solving problems from programming competitions it is, I found, not always the best to use something like Python due to the time limit imposed by the many programming problems. Sometimes C can then be much better, much faster, even when implementing the very same algorithm and as such I am here trying to get better at using C.
